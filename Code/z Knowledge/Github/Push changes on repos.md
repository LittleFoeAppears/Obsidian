1. **Stage Your Changes:** Use `git add` to stage the changes you want to include in the commit. This prepares them to be committed.
    
    bashCopy code
    
    `git add <file(s)>`
    
2. **Commit Your Changes:** Use `git commit` to commit the staged changes with a descriptive message.
    
    bashCopy code
    
    `git commit -m "Your commit message"`
    
3. **Push Your Changes:** Use `git push` to push your committed changes to the remote repository. If it's your first time pushing from this branch, you might need to set the upstream branch.
    
    bashCopy code
    
    `git push`
    
    or if it's your first time pushing from this branch:
    
    bashCopy code
    
    `git push -u origin <branch-name>`
    
4. **Enter Your GitHub Credentials:** If prompted, enter your GitHub username and password or personal access token.
    
5. **Verify Changes on GitHub:** Once pushed, verify your changes on the GitHub repository's page.
