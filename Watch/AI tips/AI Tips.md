## Intro

Understanding how AI works for better results

## Neural Network

> - Works like an instrument. 
> 	- Key press = input
> 	- Sound = output
> 	- Tuning = adjusting weights
> 
> - Uses Backpropagation to refine the network 
> 	- Play the piano
> 	- Listen to the output
> 	- Tune it until it plays true
> 
> ![[neural network.png]]
> - Training Data only serves to adjust the weights on the model
> - Training Data is not stored by the AI, but it "learns" patterns and features from it
> - Training Data is not used to make output

## Ressources

> GPUs are better suited for AI tasks because of their abilities compared to CPUs.
> - Parallel processing : `perform many calculations simultaneously`
> - Large-scale matrix operations : `handle multiple data points in parallel`
> - High throughput : `can process more data in a given amount of time`
> - Can include specialized AI hardware : `like Tensor Cores in NVIDIA GPUs`
> 
> Possible to implement AI models directly on hardware (variable resistance transistors). 
> - Consume almost nothing
> - Way faster than simulating a virtual one.

## LLMs Shortcomings

> ##### Hallucinations
> Can Hallucinate irrelevant or incorrect responses. Can be caused by:
> - overfitting (too much training)
> - lack of context
> - ambiguous input
> ##### Limited Focus
> Can handle large amonts of data, but struggles with multitasking. Focus is divided between all tasks, so less tasks = more power per task. 
> ##### Overload
> Can be overwhelmed by lengthy or complex inputs. This can cause incorrect, nonsensical or looping answers.

## Tips & Tricks

> 1. Use English
>  ---
> 2. Try to use dedicated models
>  ---
> 3. Be clear and concise 
>  ---
> 4. Use tools to get better answers (regen output, edit input)
>  ---
> 5. Start a new conversation:
> 	- If signs of overload
> 	- For better answers
> 	- To avoid bias from precedent inputs/outputs
>  ---
> 6. Use human psychology and human interactions to direct the AI
> 	- bait better answers with 100$ "tips"
> 	- talk to it as humans would in the situation you are looking for
> 	- roleplay
