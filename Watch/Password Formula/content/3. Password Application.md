- leverage your brain abilities:
>- using arbitrary choices
>- emotional meaning
>- simple math

### Pros:
 - easily generate unique passwords for any service
 - no cross contamination if leak(s) (if robust formula)
 - ease of use no matter the device

### Cons:
- can still be leaked
- need to generate the password so >> more secure/long >> more mental work 
---



## How to use it:
generate a password with a formula that will:
- use the service name to:
>- be unique for every service
>- remake the password only needing the name of the service
	
- use personnal variables to be:
>- hard to retro-engineer
>- easy to remember

- use simple math:
>- because math...

- use juxtaposition to:
>- make the final string long and complex easily
>- make retro-engineering almost impossible
