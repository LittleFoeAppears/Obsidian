1. **Nmap**: Ensure that Nmap is installed on your system.
2. **Nessus**: Install Nessus and have it configured to scan the target IP.
3. **Access to the target IP**: Ensure that you can reach the IP `10.12.1.36` from your scanning machine.


#### Manual Scan of the 10.12.1.36 Box
 
> **Identify Open Ports and Services**:
> 
>    - Use Nmap to identify open ports and services:
> 
> 		```bash
> 		nmap -sS -sV 10.12.1.36
> 		```
>   
> **Research Known Vulnerabilities**:
>    
>    - For each service identified, research known vulnerabilities using databases like CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) or Exploit-DB.
>    
> 
> **Response**:
>    - List of open ports and services.
>    - Manual research will identify how many of these services have known vulnerabilities.

### Vulnerability Scan with Nmap



>  **Run Nmap with NSE (Nmap Scripting Engine) Scripts**:
>    
> - Use specific NSE scripts to identify vulnerabilities:
> 
> 	```bash
> 	nmap --script vuln 10.12.1.36
> 	```
> 
> **Analyze the Results**:
>    
> - Review the output to determine the number of vulnerabilities and the associated services.
> 
> **Response**:
> - Number of vulnerabilities found by Nmap.
> - List of vulnerable services.

#### Vulnerability Scan with Nessus


>  **Setup and Run Nessus Scan**:
> 
> - Launch Nessus and configure a new scan.
> - Set the target to `10.12.1.36`.
> - Start the scan and wait for it to complete.
> 
> **Analyze the Results**:
> 
> - Review the report generated by Nessus to determine the number of vulnerabilities and the associated services.
> 
> **Response**:
> 
> - Number of vulnerabilities found by Nessus.
> - List of vulnerable services.
