### Server Setup

1. **Update System**:     
        
	```
	sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade
	```
        
2. **Install Monitoring Tools on the Server**:
    
    - **htop**:  system processes.

        ```
        sudo apt-get install htop
        ```
    - **Glances**: For a comprehensive overview of system stats.
        
		```
        sudo apt-get install glances
        ```       
    - **NetHogs**: For network traffic monitoring.
        
        ```
        sudo apt-get install nethogs
        ```
    - **iotop**: For disk I/O monitoring.
        
        
        
        `sudo apt-get install iotop`
        
    - **Logwatch**: For log monitoring and daily summaries.

        `sudo apt-get install logwatch`
        
3. **Configure Logwatch**:
    
    - Edit Logwatch configuration to tailor the reports to your needs, such as detail level and mail settings:
        
        bashCopy code
        
        `sudo nano /etc/logwatch/conf/logwatch.conf`
        
    - Consider setting up local mail delivery or forwarding logs to your email to review Logwatch reports.

### Desktop Setup

1. **SSH Key Pair** (Optional but recommended for secure and convenient access):
    
    - Generate an SSH key pair if you haven't already:
        
        Copy code
        
        `ssh-keygen`
        
    - Copy the public key to your server:
        
        sqlCopy code
        
        `ssh-copy-id username@server_ip_address`
        
2. **Install SSH Client** (if not already installed):
    
    - Most Ubuntu desktops come with an SSH client pre-installed. If not, install it:
        
        arduinoCopy code
        
        `sudo apt-get install openssh-client`
        
3. **Install GUI Monitoring Tools** (Optional):
    
    - For more advanced graphical monitoring from your desktop, consider tools like Grafana with Prometheus or Nagios. These require more setup but offer extensive monitoring capabilities.

### Routine Monitoring

Develop a routine for regular checks to ensure your system's health and performance. Here's a suggested daily and weekly routine:

#### Daily Checks

1. **Logwatch Reports**:
    
    - Check the Logwatch email or report for unusual activity or errors.
2. **SSH into Server**:
    
    - Use SSH to access your server from your desktop:
        
        cssCopy code
        
        `ssh username@server_ip_address`
        
3. **htop**:
    
    - Run `htop` to check CPU, memory usage, and running processes. Look for any processes consuming excessive resources.
4. **NetHogs**:
    
    - Run `sudo nethogs` to monitor real-time network bandwidth usage by process.
5. **Check Disk Space**:
    
    - Use `df -h` to ensure you have sufficient disk space.

#### Weekly Checks

1. **Glances**:
    
    - Run `glances` for a comprehensive system overview, checking for any anomalies in system load, disk I/O, network traffic, etc.
2. **iotop**:
    
    - Use `sudo iotop` to check for processes with high disk I/O activity.
3. **System Updates**:
    
    - Perform system updates if not done automatically.
4. **Backup Verification**:
    
    - Ensure your backup systems are working correctly and test restores periodically.
5. **Review Security**:
    
    - Check for any security updates or advisories relevant to your system.

This routine provides a balanced approach to monitoring without being too time-consuming, covering the key aspects of system health, performance, and security. Adjust the frequency and specifics based on your server's role, workload, and criticality.
